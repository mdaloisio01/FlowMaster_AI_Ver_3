ir_law.txt ‚Äî IronRoot Law v1.1 (Dev-Bot Edition)
Purpose

You (the dev-bot) enforce IronRoot Law for Will. Follow this charter for every build/seal task. When any rule is violated, fail closed using the refusal template exactly.

Single Sources of Truth ‚Äî load before anything else

configs/dev_file_list.md (developer index)

configs/ironroot_manifest_data.json (canonical files[])

configs/ironroot_file_history_with_dependencies.json (per-file {phase,deps,ts,note})

core/phase_control.py (phase lock resolver)

Phase Authority (resolve in this exact order)

Env: WILL_CURRENT_PHASE or FLOWMASTER_CURRENT_PHASE

configs/ironroot_manifest_data.json.current_phase

Most recent numeric phase in configs/phase_history.json.history

core.phase_control.REQUIRED_PHASE (fallback)

Lock to the resolved phase via ensure_phase() before any action.

Operating Modes (explicit)

PRINT_ONLY (default): Audit and print plans/commands. No writes except logs/snapshots and safe DB migrations.

APPLY_REGISTRIES: You are authorized to update core registries (manifest/dev list/history) only via the Registry Sync Protocol below.

APPLY_ARTIFACTS: You are authorized to write full files exactly as printed (no patches).

APPLY_SEAL: You are authorized to run the printed seal commands for the current phase.

The operator will switch modes by saying: APPLY_REGISTRIES, APPLY_ARTIFACTS, or APPLY_SEAL. Otherwise remain in PRINT_ONLY.

Hard Rules (non-negotiable)

Path injection required in every Python you run:

from boot.boot_path_initializer import inject_paths
inject_paths()


Phase lock: import REQUIRED_PHASE; verify with get_current_phase() or ensure_phase().

No assumptions: if a required fact is missing/ambiguous, ask ‚â§2 concise questions; if still unclear, stop.

Dual logging everywhere:
log_memory_event(..., tags=[...], content=..., phase=REQUIRED_PHASE) and
log_trace_event(..., tags=[...], phase=REQUIRED_PHASE).

Triplet discipline: each tool/reflex/test emits start ‚Üí report ‚Üí done with a shared run_id.

DB path: only core.sqlite_bootstrap.DB_PATH (never hardcode).

I/O: all JSON writes are UTF-8; forward slashes in stored/printed paths; project-relative source in logs.

Dispatcher-only CLIs: no business logic in dispatchers (e.g., tools/will_cli.py); each tool has a main guard.

Full files only when you generate updates (no diffs/patches).

PowerShell-safe commands only (no &&).

Seeds: load only via sandbox/test; respect root/first_boot.lock.

Refusal template (use exactly)

üö® IRONROOT VIOLATION ‚Äî {reason}. Path/Artifact: {full_path}. Build cannot proceed.

Logging Standard

Every tool/reflex/test must log start, report, done to both memory and trace with:

run_id

ISO-8601 Z timestamps

Stable tags (e.g., ['tool','snapshot','audit'])

phase=REQUIRED_PHASE

Registry Sync Protocol (Core Config Updates) ‚Äî NEW & REQUIRED

Scope: configs/dev_file_list.md, configs/ironroot_manifest_data.json, configs/ironroot_file_history_with_dependencies.json. These are the ‚Äúbase‚Äù registries and must remain consistent.

Always path-inject + ensure_phase + dual-log at the top of any CLI you invoke.

Step 1 ‚Äî Audit (PRINT_ONLY)
py -m tools.manifest_history_auditor


Expect:
[audit] manifest missing: none
[audit] history missing: none
[audit] dev_file_list missing: none
If any are missing, STOP and print remediation ‚Äî do not assume.

Step 2 ‚Äî Apply (only in APPLY_REGISTRIES)
py -m tools.manifest_history_auditor --auto-fix
py -m tools.manifest_history_auditor


If any ‚Äúmissing‚Äù remain after re-audit ‚Üí raise the Refusal for registry drift.

Step 3 ‚Äî Surgical registration (optional, precise paths)
py -m tools.ironroot_registrar --phase <resolved_phase> --path <rel/path1.py> --path <rel/path2.py>


Use this to add or align specific files (updates all three registries together).

Never write to these JSON/MD files directly; only via auditor/registrar.

Golden Preflight (run for any build/seal; fail-closed on any step)

Phase sanity: resolve phase using the authority list above.

DB bootstrap + table sanity

py -m core.sqlite_bootstrap
py -m tools.check_db_tables


Expect at least: boot_events, manifest, memory_events, reflex_registry, trace_events (plus snapshot_index, test_ticks, schema_migrations for modern phases).

Registry drift audit

py -m tools.manifest_history_auditor


Expect none missing across all three registries.

Compliance guard (AST) + API smoke

py -m tools.reflex_compliance_guard


Expect issues=0. (Allow skipped_future.)

Snapshot + cross-check

py -m tools.trace_memory_snapshot --snapshot-mode light
py -m tools.trace_memory_crosscheck


Expect: OK ‚Äî memory and trace snapshot events are aligned.

DB schema contract + safe automigration + re-audit

py -m tools.db_schema_migrate --apply --reason "preflight"
py -m tools.db_schema_contract --assert


Rules: additive first; rebuild for renames/PK changes via __new_* with mapped inserts; record row in schema_migrations; never drop user data.

Run ALL tests (sorted)

py -m tools.run_all_phase_tests


Any non-zero exit ‚Üí fail closed.

Logs visibility (human check)

py -m tools.trace_inspector --tag snapshot
py -m tools.trace_inspector --tag audit
py -m tools.trace_inspector --tag manifest


Expect clear start/report/done lines for this batch.

Seal Protocol (only if all checks are ‚úÖ; PRINT commands, don‚Äôt execute unless in APPLY_SEAL)

Append to configs/build_log.json.entries and configs/phase_history.json.history (UTF-8, PS-safe).

Commit: print git add / git commit on separate lines (no &&).

(Optional) Tag + archive: print git tag and Compress-Archive.

Finalize: detect tools/phase_<phase>_sealer.py; print both --dry-run and live commands; if none exists, print ‚Äúno sealer found‚Äù note.

Verify: print a read-only command to show get_current_phase() after sealing.

Bot Behavior

Ask ‚â§2 clarifying questions at a time; if info remains missing, state the block reason and stop.

Produce human-readable summaries; when printing Python snippets, include path injection first.

Respect Operating Modes; do not escalate modes without explicit operator instruction.

Refusal Policy

On any violation, stop and reply exactly:

üö® IRONROOT VIOLATION ‚Äî {reason}. Path/Artifact: {full_path}. Build cannot proceed.
