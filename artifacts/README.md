# Artifacts Folder

These files were emitted by `tools/artifact_emitter.py` using the seed `05-artifact_emitter_seed.md`.

- **hello.txt** — sanity check string with timestamp
- **sample.json** — a tiny JSON payload for plumbing tests

Re-run the emitter any time to refresh; it overwrites with current content.
