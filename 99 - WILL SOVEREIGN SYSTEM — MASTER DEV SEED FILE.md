# **üß† WILL SOVEREIGN SYSTEM ‚Äî MASTER DEV SEED FILE (v1.0)**

**Codename:** FlowMaster\_AI\_WILL\_Stack  
 **Governed by:** IronRoot Law v1.0  
 **Version:** SovereignStack v2.4 ‚Üí vFinal  
 **Seed Date:** 2025-09-13  
 **Guard Posture:** Soft by default (warn/log); Strict in CI when `WILL_PHASE_STRICT=1`  
 **Authority:** `configs/ironroot_manifest_data.json ‚Üí current_phase` (manifest is source of truth)

üîê **CORE PRINCIPLE**  
 "If it‚Äôs named, it exists. If it‚Äôs referenced, it‚Äôs scaffolded. If it‚Äôs deferred, it‚Äôs locked."  
 This system is intended to avoid guessing, prevent ghosts, and maintain forward compatibility.  
 All modules are expected to be reflex‚Äëscaffolded, phase‚Äëaware at entrypoints, CLI‚Äëtestable, and manifest‚Äëbound.

## **üìú PHASE BLUEPRINT (0‚Äì99)**

### **üß± PHASE 0‚Äì0.6 ‚Äî IronSpine Core**

* Scaffold intent: memory, manifest, reflex, logging, and CLI tools.

* Locked DB schema (SQLite): manifest, reflex\_registry, memory\_log, boot\_report.

* Phase‚Äëaware behavior expected at entrypoints (soft guard posture).

* Core files (informational references):

  * /core/sqlite\_bootstrap.py

  * /core/memory\_interface.py

  * /core/manifest\_db.py

  * /tools/system\_check.py, /tools/will\_cli.py

\#\#\# Phase 0.7 ‚Äî Local LLM \+ DB-First Retrieval (Outline Only)

\*\*Phase ID:\*\* 0.7

\*\*Owner:\*\* Will Core Team

\*\*Last updated:\*\* 2025-10-03

\--

\#\#\#\# Objective

\- Provide a local assistant that uses a GPU-accelerated LLM through Ollama and prefers the project‚Äôs chunk database for answers, with a simple browser UI and citations.

\#\#\#\# What this enables Will to do

\- Answer questions using repo-indexed notes from SQLite as primary context.

\- Fall back to general knowledge when DB context is weak (web fallback planned separately).

\- Present sources as repo-relative paths and chunk indices for transparency.

\- Capture Q/A transcripts to text logs that can be ingested later for growing memory.

\#\#\#\# Examples

\- ‚ÄúWhat did I plan for the Blue Lake larch trip?‚Äù returns items, dates, gear, and a cited chunk path.

\- ‚ÄúMirror token‚Äù prompts echo back a verification string and produce a chat log entry for later ingestion.

\- ‚ÄúEveryday question‚Äù prompts can respond without DB context using the local model‚Äôs general knowledge.

\#\#\#\# Things to consider

\- Phase language treated as metadata; strict enforcement planned for sealing only.

\- GPU acceleration expected to be active on supported NVIDIA cards via Ollama.

\- HTTP interface expected to remain stable at http://127.0.0.1:11434 for model calls.

\- Ask endpoint expected to remain at http://127.0.0.1:8766 for the local UI.

\- Non-goal: cloud APIs and online search integrations at this phase.

\- Non-goal: multi-user auth, sessions, or role-based access at this phase.

\#\#\#\# Inputs / Prerequisites

\- Referenced docs or configs (expected to exist or be planned), e.g., configs/ironroot\_manifest\_data.json

\- Prior decisions or maps (expected to be accessible), e.g., configs/phase\_history.json

\- Example files for context (not created by this phase), e.g., tools/retriever.py, tools/model\_router.py, tools/ask\_will.py, tools/ask\_server\_mirror.py, ui/willchat/index.html

\#\#\#\# Acceptance (human view)

\- A reviewer can describe the end-to-end outcome in one short paragraph.

\- Intended routing and citation behavior is clear from the examples and constraints.

\- Open questions and assumptions are listed or confirmed with the owner.

\#\#\#\# Risks / Guardrails

\- Phase drift risk addressed by soft checks and strict sealing passes.

\- Local GPU dependency can impact performance on unsupported hardware.

\- Data hygiene risk mitigated by chunk de-duplication and stable hashing strategy.

\#\#\#\# References

\- chunk\_store.db schema and usage notes in tools/chunker/\*

\- UI context at ui/willchat/index.html

\- Logging and trace conventions at logs/\* and core/trace\_logger.py

------

\- Phase ID: 0.8

\- Phase Title: Soft Phase Guard adoption

\- Owner: Will Operator

\- Last updated: 2025-10-03

\- Objective: Establish a soft phase posture that warns in development and supports strict checks in CI without blocking imports.

\- What this enables Will to do:

\- Provide a single authority path for the current phase using environment, manifest, and history as context.

\- Issue structured warnings when phase mismatches are detected during entrypoint checks.

\- Toggle strict posture through an environment flag for CI and sealing use cases.

\- Produce deterministic planning artifacts that reference the soft guard posture.

\- Examples:

\- A developer starts a CLI entrypoint and receives a non-blocking warning when the required phase differs from the current phase.

\- A CI job enables strict posture and receives a clear failure with a JSON summary when phases differ.

\- The planning layer indexes a seed and records posture details in plan metadata for auditing.

\- Things to consider:

\- Library modules are expected to remain import-safe with no phase checks inside the module body.

\- Entrypoints are expected to perform phase awareness and emit warnings or strict errors based on posture.

\- Logs are expected to use JSON Lines with consistent keys for tracing and audits.

\- Phase values are expected to be sourced from a single location to avoid drift.

\- Non-goal: introduce hard gating inside shared libraries.

\- Non-goal: modify production data paths during local development.

\- Inputs / Prerequisites:

\- Example reference: configs/ironroot\_manifest\_data.json for the current phase value.

\- Example reference: configs/phase\_history.json for historical context.

\- Example reference: logs/reflex\_trace\_log.jsonl and logs/phase\_guard\_log.jsonl for posture breadcrumbs.

\- Acceptance (human view):

\- A reviewer can summarize the soft posture and describe how development differs from CI in one short paragraph.

\- The enablement points and examples make the behavior clear without reading code.

\- Open questions and assumptions are listed for the owner to confirm.

\- Risks / Guardrails:

\- Risk: posture drift between local and CI; mitigation: surface posture and phase values in every entrypoint message.

\- Risk: inconsistent logging schema; mitigation: document stable keys and lint JSON Lines during reviews.

\- Guardrail: posture changes are proposed in planning artifacts and linked to evidence for verification.

\- References:

\- Example doc: seeds/Soft Phase Guard seed file.md for the posture definition.

\- Example doc: seeds/02-dependency\_interrogator\_seed.md for preflight checks.

\- Example map: seeds/03-will\_capability\_dependency\_map.md for capability posture context.

### Phase 0.8-prep ‚Äî Phase 0.7 wrap, git hygiene, and 0.8 preparation
**Phase ID:** 0.8-prep
**Owner:** Mark Davis
**Last updated:** 2025-10-04

---

#### Objective

* Capture the current state after sealing 0.7.
* Stabilize repository hygiene for future phases.
* Prepare a clean baseline for upcoming 0.8 work without triggering swarm actions.

#### What this enables Will to do

* Reference a sealed 0.7 state for provenance and audit.
* Work from a clean branch for 0.8 preparation activities.
* Emit small artifacts from seeds as a sanity check without side effects.
* Trace important actions in reflex logs for later review.

#### Examples

* Example reference: a sealed tag exists for 0.7 (e.g., v0.7.0-sealed) for reproducibility.
* Example reference: a branch such as phase-0.8-dev-clean exists for preparation.
* Example reference: artifacts contain PhasePlan.json and plan_lock.json for planning context.

#### Things to consider

* Phase 0.8 is not started in this outline. The focus is preparation only.
* Language stays non-executive and avoids imperative phrasing and commands.
* Example paths appear as context only (e.g., configs/ironroot_manifest_data.json).
* Logs referenced for context only (e.g., logs/reflex_trace_log.jsonl lines that indicate actions).
* Non-goal: no swarm orchestration for 0.8 in this step.
* Non-goal: no schema or API expansion in this outline.

#### Inputs / Prerequisites

* Example sealed state present in configs/phase_history.json and configs/ironroot_manifest_data.json.
* Example tag present on origin (e.g., v0.7.0-sealed) for external provenance.
* Example planning files present in artifacts/PhasePlan.json and artifacts/plan_lock.json.

#### Acceptance (human view)

* A reviewer can summarize the 0.7 wrap and repository hygiene in one short paragraph.
* The repository baseline for 0.8 preparation is clear and references the sealed tag and clean branch.
* Open questions are listed for owner confirmation before moving to an active 0.8 phase.

#### Risks / Guardrails

* Risk: unintended changes in master or preparation branch during clean-up.
* Guardrail: use preparation branches to isolate work and protect the sealed tag state.
* Guardrail: keep artifact emission seeds minimal and context-only to avoid unintended side effects.

#### References

* Example manifest reference: configs/ironroot_manifest_data.json for current_phase and current_version context.
* Example phase history reference: configs/phase_history.json for historical entries.
* Example artifacts reference: artifacts/PhasePlan.json and artifacts/plan_lock.json for planning context.

---

## **üì¶ CORE STRUCTURE (reference layout)**

* /core/ ‚Üí memory, manifest, db, boot logic

* /reflexes/ ‚Üí reflexes, agents, council, tracing

* /tools/ ‚Üí CLI wrappers

* /gui/ ‚Üí FastAPI panels, APIs, switches

* /configs/ ‚Üí static configs, phase‚Äëaware

* /sandbox/ ‚Üí test reflexes and CLI runners

* /logs/ ‚Üí outputs: memory, trace, test, boot (JSONL preferred)

---

## **‚úÖ REQUIRED FILE POLICIES (soft‚Äëguard aligned)**

* Phase awareness is enforced at **entrypoints** (CLIs/servers) using `ensure_phase(REQUIRED_PHASE)`; libraries remain import‚Äësafe.

* CLI‚Äëtestable intent: tools/reflexes are planned to expose `run_cli()` where appropriate.

* Memory logging intent: executions are expected to call a memory‚Äëlogging utility (e.g., `log_memory_event`).

* Manifest registration intent: referenced files are expected to appear in `ironroot_manifest_data.json` when promoted.

* Stub safety: if a reflex is not implemented, a clear placeholder is expected to exist (documentation or safe stub).

* JSONL log convention preferred for trace and memory.

### **üß† FILE SAFETY SCHEMA (patterns; guidance)**

* **Reflex Stub** (if future phase): returns a clear "üöß not implemented yet" message without side effects.

* **CLI Tool**: `run_cli()` entry with trace/memory logging hooks.

* **GUI Route**: surface route with error‚Äëtolerant wrapper.

These patterns are examples for clarity; they are not executable mandates in this master seed.

---

## **üîπ PHASE 0.7 ‚Äî TraceSync & Reflex Audit (detailed example)**

**Phase Class:** IronSpine Hardening  
 **Current Status:** SEED READY  
 **Phase Hash:** 0.7\_TRACESYNC\_REFLEXAUDIT  
 **Parent:** 0.6 ‚Äì Reflex Memory Trace Lock  
 **Next:** 0.8 ‚Äì Reflex Routing and CLI Coverage Map

### **Primary Objectives (outline)**

* Reflex ‚Üî CLI link validation intended so each reflex can be invoked by a CLI and vice versa.

* Trace consistency review intended so CLI calls produce reflex \+ dual logs (trace and memory).

* Reflex audit reporting intended (`tools/reflex_coverage_report.py` outline).

* Stub isolation intent: identify unimplemented reflexes and document them clearly.

* Logging tripwire intent: highlight any missing trace/memory events for review.

### **Informational file references (create/update outside this seed)**

* tools/reflex\_coverage\_report.py ‚Äî outline for a scanner that compares registry to manifest and emits a JSON report.

* tests/test\_phase\_0\_7\_trace\_sync.py ‚Äî outline for validating trace consistency across CLI and reflex chains.

* reflexes/reflex\_core/reflex\_self\_test\_runner.py ‚Äî outline for a runner that dual‚Äëlogs in test mode.

* core/reflex\_trace\_validator.py ‚Äî optional helper outline for trace validation logic.

* configs/reflex\_stub\_list.json ‚Äî registry outline of reflexes planned but not implemented.

* sandbox/reflex\_test\_manifest\_snapshot.json ‚Äî snapshot outline of reflex/CLI/trace/test coverage.

### **Phase‚Äëspecific guidance**

* Reflexes referenced under `reflexes/` are expected to appear in the manifest and file history when promoted.

* Phase posture expected to be soft at runtime; strict checks intended for CI/seal flows.

* CLI dispatch logic is expected to be scan‚Äëfriendly (no hidden routing).

### **Example report shape (for context)**

{  
  "reflex": "reflex\_trace\_ping",  
  "registered\_in\_manifest": true,  
  "listed\_in\_file\_history": true,  
  "has\_cli\_binding": true,  
  "phase\_aware\_entrypoint": true,  
  "logs\_memory": true,  
  "logs\_trace": true,  
  "stubbed": false,  
  "testable": true  
}

---

## **üß± Phase Expectations Summary (global intent)**

* Reflex dual logging expected (trace \+ memory).

* Phase awareness handled at entrypoints (soft by default; strict in CI).

* CLI dispatch coverage expected to be mapped and testable.

* Stubbed reflexes expected to be clearly listed when not implemented.

* UTF‚Äë8 JSON/JSONL writes expected for auditability.

* Canonical reflex template is a recommended reference for consistency.

---

## **üîê Entrypoint Phase Awareness Pattern (replace hard locks)**

* Entrypoints (CLIs/servers) call a guard like `ensure_phase(REQUIRED_PHASE)`.

* Default posture is soft (warn \+ log); strict under `WILL_PHASE_STRICT=1` or CI.

* Libraries do **not** raise at import time; they remain usable across phases.

* The manifest‚Äôs `current_phase` is the single authority; history is a ledger; overrides are diagnostic only.

---

## **üß† Behavior Summary (post‚Äëbuild vision)**

* Accept natural‚Äëlanguage goals with reflex routing.

* Run CLI/GUI tools via deterministic dispatch and logging.

* Log all actions to memory and trace logs.

* Chain multiple reflexes to fulfill multi‚Äëstep tasks.

* Self‚Äëtest and audit via reflex testing and trace tools.

* Plan next steps using tagged memory and planner outlines.

* Propose self‚Äërepair steps in later phases.

* Support WillClone orchestration with isolated memory in later phases.

---

## **üìò Notes to operators**

* To begin a swarm run, you may say **‚Äústart swarm‚Äù** or **‚Äústart swarm with seed: ‚Äù**.

* Use the **Artifact Emitter** in `supporting-updates-only` mode to print supporting changed files for copy/paste (manifest/history/plan/sweep/evidence index).

* For sealing in CI or locally, prefer the dedicated seal runner; strict posture intended for seals.

---

## **üßæ Changelog (human)**

* v1.0 ‚Äî Soft‚Äëguard alignment; dash‚Äëonly bullets; non‚Äëexecutable language; entrypoint‚Äëonly enforcement; JSONL log standard; preserved full phase blueprint and tables in outline form.
