Say the word.You said:Each party seems insistent that the other will "own" the effects of a government shutdown and shoulder the blame from the American public.

"Republicans will bear the responsibility for another painful government shutdown because of the refusal of GOP congressional leadership to even talk with Democrats," Schumer and Jeffries said.

On Friday, House Speaker Mike Johnson said he was open to meeting with top Democrats but added "there isn't much to discuss" since Democrats announced they wouldn't stand with Republicans on a short-term stopgap bill.

"If they choose to vote against this clean, completely nonpartisan [spending bill], then they will be choosing to shut the government down and they'll own the consequences," Johnson told reporters.

Say the word or just drop the next test block.You said:WASHINGTON — The Senate voted Friday to block dueling Republican and Democratic proposals to keep the federal government funded on a short-term basis, raising the chances of a shutdown at the end of the month.

The Republican plan, which passed by GOP-controlled House by a vote of 217-212 earlier Friday, fell short of the 60 votes needed to break a filibuster in the Senate: The vote was 44-48, with Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania the only Democrat to vote yes, and Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska the only Republicans voting no.

A competing Democratic plan also failed to clear the 60-vote threshold. That vote was 47-45, along party lines, with seven senators — all Republicans — missing the vote.

The failures underscore the divide between the two parties and leave Congress with no clear path forward to avoid a government shutdown that is set to begin on Oct. 1 at 12:01 a.m. Both chambers are expected to take at least part of next week off for Rosh Hashanah.

Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office Friday afternoon, President Donald Trump repeatedly bashed Democrats before saying, "We’ll continue to talk to the Democrats, but you could very well end up with a closed country for a period of time."

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and other Democrats had vowed to defeat the House GOP bill, which would have funded the government at current spending levels through Nov. 21. Republicans did not negotiate the bill with Democrats prior to its release, and the minority party instead offered their own funding legislation.

The measure backed by Democrats in both chambers would have funded the government through Oct. 31 with a series of policy add-ons. It would permanently extend Obamacare subsidies set to expire at the end of the year, as well as reverse Medicaid cuts enacted in Trump’s “big, beautiful bill.”

It also aimed to address Trump funding cuts that have infuriated Democrats in recent months: It would lift the freeze on foreign aid funding that the White House is withholding through “pocket rescissions” and restore funding for public broadcasting.

“Democrats have a different option. We address the crises Americans face in health care, in Medicaid, in inflation and in higher costs,” Schumer told reporters Thursday.

Just one Democrat, Rep. Jared Golden of Maine, joined Republicans in voting for the House GOP spending bill. Two Republicans — Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Victoria Spartz of Indiana — joined all other Democrats to vote against the bill.

In the Senate, Democrats have stiffened their resolve against backing a bill they didn't sign off on. That's a shift from March, when 10 Democrats — including Schumer — voted to pass a six-month bill written by Republicans.

What happens next is uncertain.

Any bill to avert a shutdown and buy appropriators more time to strike a longer-term funding deal must be bipartisan to clear the Senate's 60-vote threshold.

Schumer and other Democrats noted that Trump has publicly called on House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., not to sit down and negotiate with Democrats on the short-term funding bill.
