Say the word or just drop the next test block.You said:WASHINGTON — The Senate voted Friday to block dueling Republican and Democratic proposals to keep the federal government funded on a short-term basis, raising the chances of a shutdown at the end of the month.

The Republican plan, which passed by GOP-controlled House by a vote of 217-212 earlier Friday, fell short of the 60 votes needed to break a filibuster in the Senate: The vote was 44-48, with Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania the only Democrat to vote yes, and Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska the only Republicans voting no.

A competing Democratic plan also failed to clear the 60-vote threshold. That vote was 47-45, along party lines, with seven senators — all Republicans — missing the vote.

The failures underscore the divide between the two parties and leave Congress with no clear path forward to avoid a government shutdown that is set to begin on Oct. 1 at 12:01 a.m. Both chambers are expected to take at least part of next week off for Rosh Hashanah.

Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office Friday afternoon, President Donald Trump repeatedly bashed Democrats before saying, "We’ll continue to talk to the Democrats, but you could very well end up with a closed country for a period of time."

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and other Democrats had vowed to defeat the House GOP bill, which would have funded the government at current spending levels through Nov. 21. Republicans did not negotiate the bill with Democrats prior to its release, and the minority party instead offered their own funding legislation.

The measure backed by Democrats in both chambers would have funded the government through Oct. 31 with a series of policy add-ons. It would permanently extend Obamacare subsidies set to expire at the end of the year, as well as reverse Medicaid cuts enacted in Trump’s “big, beautiful bill.”

It also aimed to address Trump funding cuts that have infuriated Democrats in recent months: It would lift the freeze on foreign aid funding that the White House is withholding through “pocket rescissions” and restore funding for public broadcasting.

“Democrats have a different option. We address the crises Americans face in health care, in Medicaid, in inflation and in higher costs,” Schumer told reporters Thursday.

Just one Democrat, Rep. Jared Golden of Maine, joined Republicans in voting for the House GOP spending bill. Two Republicans — Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Victoria Spartz of Indiana — joined all other Democrats to vote against the bill.

In the Senate, Democrats have stiffened their resolve against backing a bill they didn't sign off on. That's a shift from March, when 10 Democrats — including Schumer — voted to pass a six-month bill written by Republicans.

What happens next is uncertain.

Congress
Sen. Rand Paul calls FCC chair's threats to ABC over Jimmy Kimmel 'absolutely inappropriate'
Any bill to avert a shutdown and buy appropriators more time to strike a longer-term funding deal must be bipartisan to clear the Senate's 60-vote threshold.

Schumer and other Democrats noted that Trump has publicly called on House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., not to sit down and negotiate with Democrats on the short-term funding bill.

“Donald Trump made it clear, don’t even bother dealing with the Democrats," Schumer said, referencing an interview Trump gave to Fox News. "Thune and Johnson listen to Trump. They are not independent actors. They don’t represent an independent Congress, an independent House or an independent Senate. And when Donald Trump says don’t negotiate with Democrats, they don’t and come up with 20 excuses.”

In the wake of the Charlie Kirk assassination, the House bill includes $58 million for additional executive and judicial branch security. It also includes $30 million for extra security for members of Congress, including mutual aid, which reimburses local police for costs incurred protecting lawmakers at their homes or at town halls and other public events. The Democratic alternative also includes enhanced security money.

Johnson, in an appearance on Fox News on Thursday night, defended the GOP legislation, which is backed by Trump. Johnson has characterized it as a "clean" CR, a point disputed by Democrats who argue it extends "status quo" funding levels that were driven down by Trump's cuts.

“Chuck Schumer chose to try to make this a partisan exercise, and Hakeem Jeffries as well. And it’s wrong to do that,” Johnson told reporters Friday after the successful House vote. “And so if they choose to vote against this clean, completely nonpartisan CR, then they will be choosing to shut the government down, and they will own the consequences of what happens following that."

Unless the House and the Senate can pass the same funding legislation and earn Trump's signature, the government will shut down Oct. 1, the start of the new fiscal year. In a shutdown, mandatory services, such as Border Patrol, the Postal Service and Social Security, will continue, but federal workers, including the military, will go unpaid.

Both the House and the Senate are scheduled to be on recess next week. The House had planned to be back in session Sept. 29 and 30, but GOP leaders on Friday scrapped those days to put more pressure on Senate Democrats to swallow the House-passed bill.

Appropriations Committee leaders in both parties are negotiating even more security funding in their spending bills for fiscal year 2026.

"When you have a big event like we had with the tragic shooting of our friend Charlie Kirk, it draws attention to it, and we’re in a constant process of improvement, making sure that we have the latest and greatest technology and resources available," Johnson said on Fox.

"So that’s the process we’ve been going through. We’re adding additional funding and measures to ensure that everybody is safe and that they can do their job representing the people from back home."

TRUMP'S U-TURN ON H-1B
Since taking office in January, Trump has kicked off a wide-ranging immigration crackdown, including moves to limit some forms of legal immigration.
This step to reshape the H-1B visa program represents his administration's most high-profile effort yet to rework temporary employment visas and underscores what critics have said is a protectionist agenda.
It is a U-turn from Trump's earlier stance when he sided with one-time ally and Tesla (TSLA.O), opens new tab CEO Elon Musk in a public dispute over the use of the H-1B visa, saying he fully backed the program for foreign tech workers even though it was opposed by some of his supporters.
Trump administration officials say the visa allows companies to suppress wages, and curbing it opens more jobs for American tech workers. Supporters of the program argue that it brings in highly skilled workers essential to filling talent gaps and keeping firms competitive.
In the hours following Trump's proclamation, social media was flooded with debate on the scope of the order and dismay at what many saw as a move that dimmed America's lure as an attractive destination to work in.
An anonymous user on Rednote said their life was like that of a "H-1B slave." The person cut short a holiday in Tokyo to rush back to the United States, describing it as "a real-life 'Fast & Furious' return to the U.S.," a reference to the hit Hollywood series about street racing.
The Secretary of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem, could exempt petitioners from the fee at her discretion, the proclamation said.
Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on Friday said companies would have to pay $100,000 per year for H-1B worker visas.
However, White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said in a post on X on Saturday that this was not an annual fee, only a one-time fee that applied to each new petition.
India was the largest beneficiary of H-1B visas last year, accounting for 71% of approved beneficiaries, while China was a distant second at 11.7%, according to government data.
Amid the confusion, Rohan Singh, who works as a manufacturing engineer in North Carolina, cancelled his plan to visit India. "There is panic among H-1B visa holders because we do not know what’s ahead," the 30-year-old said.
A Nvidia (NVDA.O), opens new tab engineer, who has lived in the U.S. for 10 years, told Reuters at the San Francisco airport that he had been vacationing in Japan with his wife and infant when he rushed to reschedule his return flight after hearing the news.
"It feels surreal," he said. "Everything is changing in an instant.”

Boone was present during the 25-day confrontation between the Marines and Germans at Belleau Wood in June 1918.

Born in St. Clair, Pennsylvania, on Aug. 29, 1889, Joel Thompson Boone was a cousin several times removed from the legendary frontier pathfinder Daniel Boone. The relationship ended there, though. Graduating from Mercersburg Academy in June 1913, followed by attending Hahnemann Medical College, Philadelphia, Boone was commissioned a lieutenant (junior grade) in the U.S. Naval Reserve in 1914. After attending the U.S. Naval Medical School in Washington, D.C., he graduated with a Regular Navy commission in the summer of 1915.

Later in 1915, Boone got his first foreign assignment with the Marine Artillery Regiment of the Marine Expeditionary Force suppressing the Cacos Rebellion in Haiti. It was there where he was made medical officer for the 13th Marine Company.

By April 1917, Boone was serving aboard the battleship USS Wyoming (BB-32) when the United States declared war on Germany and in June of that year he was temporarily promoted to full lieutenant.

Boone faced his first challenge on June 9, when the 6th Marines’ regimental aid station was demolished by enemy shells and was bombarded again on the 10th, killing 10 Marines and wounding many more.

On June 25, he followed a battalion pressing against machine gun positions, establishing advance dressing stations under continuous shell fire. For his performance throughout the intense fighting at Belleau Wood, Boone was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross.

The final turning point of World War I on the Western Front began on July 14 as the German army tried to force its way across the Marne River and on to Paris — only to be stopped there by the French and American armies.

On July 19, Surg. Boone left the shelter of his field station and into an open field southeast of Vierzy, near a cemetery on the road south. Under a heavy barrage of large caliber shells, Boone calmly but swiftly traversed the scant cover to recover wounded Marines, apply tourniquets and dress wounds.

Casualties were so heavy that he used up his dressings and supplies, so he commandeered a motorcycle and drove to the rear through a blitz of explosives and gas, then, as his citation states, “returned quickly with a sidecar load.”

Such were the day’s casualties that his medical supplies were again used up, so “A second trip under the same conditions and for the same purpose, was made by Surg. Boone later that day.”

Somehow he survived and dozens of front-line witnesses testified to the exploits of the naval officer who became a legend among the 6th Marines.

Promoted to lieutenant commander in September, Boone made it through the war to the armistice on Nov. 11, 1918. His life-saving actions on July 25 was recognized by the Navy, which later saw Boone awarded the Medal of Honor. That, along with the DSC, six Silver Stars, Bronze Star with “V,” two Purple Hearts, French Officier de la Légion d’Honneur and Croix de Guerre with two bronze stars, added up to his ultimate status as the most decorated medical officer in the U.S. Armed Services.

Boone continued his naval career through World War II and Korea, one of the few Americans to have served in four conflicts. He represented the American medical forces on the deck of battleship Missouri when the Japanese surrendered on Sept. 2, 1945. He also served in the White House physician to Presidents Warren G. Harding, Calvin Coolidge, Herbert Hoover and, briefly, Franklin D. Roosevelt.

Vice Adm. Joel Boone died in Washington, D.C. on April 2, 1974, and was buried in Arlington National Cemetery, later joined by his wife, Helen Elizabeth.

Boone was present during the 25-day confrontation between the Marines and Germans at Belleau Wood in June 1918.

Born in St. Clair, Pennsylvania, on Aug. 29, 1889, Joel Thompson Boone was a cousin several times removed from the legendary frontier pathfinder Daniel Boone. The relationship ended there, though. Graduating from Mercersburg Academy in June 1913, followed by attending Hahnemann Medical College, Philadelphia, Boone was commissioned a lieutenant (junior grade) in the U.S. Naval Reserve in 1914. After attending the U.S. Naval Medical School in Washington, D.C., he graduated with a Regular Navy commission in the summer of 1915.

Later in 1915, Boone got his first foreign assignment with the Marine Artillery Regiment of the Marine Expeditionary Force suppressing the Cacos Rebellion in Haiti. It was there where he was made medical officer for the 13th Marine Company.

By April 1917, Boone was serving aboard the battleship USS Wyoming (BB-32) when the United States declared war on Germany and in June of that year he was temporarily promoted to full lieutenant.

Boone faced his first challenge on June 9, when the 6th Marines’ regimental aid station was demolished by enemy shells and was bombarded again on the 10th, killing 10 Marines and wounding many more.

On June 25, he followed a battalion pressing against machine gun positions, establishing advance dressing stations under continuous shell fire. For his performance throughout the intense fighting at Belleau Wood, Boone was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross.

The final turning point of World War I on the Western Front began on July 14 as the German army tried to force its way across the Marne River and on to Paris — only to be stopped there by the French and American armies.

On July 19, Surg. Boone left the shelter of his field station and into an open field southeast of Vierzy, near a cemetery on the road south. Under a heavy barrage of large caliber shells, Boone calmly but swiftly traversed the scant cover to recover wounded Marines, apply tourniquets and dress wounds.

Casualties were so heavy that he used up his dressings and supplies, so he commandeered a motorcycle and drove to the rear through a blitz of explosives and gas, then, as his citation states, “returned quickly with a sidecar load.”

Such were the day’s casualties that his medical supplies were again used up, so “A second trip under the same conditions and for the same purpose, was made by Surg. Boone later that day.”

Somehow he survived and dozens of front-line witnesses testified to the exploits of the naval officer who became a legend among the 6th Marines.

Promoted to lieutenant commander in September, Boone made it through the war to the armistice on Nov. 11, 1918. His life-saving actions on July 25 was recognized by the Navy, which later saw Boone awarded the Medal of Honor. That, along with the DSC, six Silver Stars, Bronze Star with “V,” two Purple Hearts, French Officier de la Légion d’Honneur and Croix de Guerre with two bronze stars, added up to his ultimate status as the most decorated medical officer in the U.S. Armed Services.

Boone continued his naval career through World War II and Korea, one of the few Americans to have served in four conflicts. He represented the American medical forces on the deck of battleship Missouri when the Japanese surrendered on Sept. 2, 1945. He also served in the White House physician to Presidents Warren G. Harding, Calvin Coolidge, Herbert Hoover and, briefly, Franklin D. Roosevelt.

Vice Adm. Joel Boone died in Washington, D.C. on April 2, 1974, and was buried in Arlington National Cemetery, later joined by his wife, Helen Elizabeth.
