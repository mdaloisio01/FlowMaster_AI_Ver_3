# ui_rendering_seed.md

## Purpose
Defines how Will’s user interface (UI) should render, adapt, and evolve over time — with a focus on clarity, speed, and intelligent flexibility. This seed ensures Will can dynamically serve, adjust, and optimize its UI experience across platforms.

---

## Core UI Behaviors

- **Dark Mode Default**: Use high-contrast dark themes optimized for long use sessions.
- **Monospaced Fonts**: System-wide default for readability and developer friendliness.
- **Layout Structure**:
  - Chat container: scrollable, timestamped messages
  - Prompt input: single-field, Enter to send
  - Session switcher: persistent top-left dropdown
- **Responsive Design**: UI must work across desktop, tablet, and mobile views.
- **Minimalist Aesthetic**: Avoid bloat. Favor utility over fancy UI effects.

---

## Reflex-Integrated Features

- Buttons, fields, and forms may trigger reflexes directly (e.g., `will ui toggle console`).
- Reflex triggers are tagged with `data-reflex` attributes or bound via JS listeners.
- Reflexes can add, modify, or remove DOM elements in real time.

---

## Enhancement & Future-Proofing

### 1. AI-Powered Layout Optimization
- Will observes usage behavior to suggest UI rearrangements.
- Layout suggestions are offered via `will ui optimize`.

### 2. Reflex Component Hot-Reloading
- Load UI modules dynamically without full reload.
- Enables “live” debug views, status dashboards, and extensible GUIs.

### 3. Live Theming Mode
- Will supports real-time theme previews (e.g., via toggle or command).
- Future: `will ui theme preview <name>`

### 4. Role-Based UI Lockdown
- Admin/Viewer roles define which UI blocks are visible or usable.
- Will checks role context before exposing sensitive elements.

### 5. Modular UI Loader
- Components can be placed in `/components/*.html` or `/modules/*.js`.
- Will loads these dynamically on startup or as needed.

---

## Testing & Maintenance Tools

### Reflex: `will ui test`
- Validates core UI functions:
  - Message input works
  - Buttons present and clickable
  - Layout loads without JS errors

### Reflex: `will ui toggle console`
- Embedded dev console to display:
  - Real-time logs
  - Errors
  - Reflex activity

---

## Export / Screenshot Features

- Reflex: `will ui capture`
- Saves current UI as PNG for feedback or documentation.

---

## Accessibility (A11y) Support

- Follows WCAG 2.1 guidelines.
- Reflex: `will ui audit a11y` to:
  - Detect bad contrast
  - Check missing ARIA labels
  - Suggest improvements

---

## Localization Support

- All static strings live in `/locales/*.json`.
- Reflex: `will ui switch language <lang>` to toggle.

---

## Identity Hooks

- UI must reflect system identity:
  - Ironroot = strong, structured, professional
  - FlowMaster = clean, modular control center
  - Roaming Raven = adventurous, elegant, visual

---

## Notes

- All UI behaviors should degrade gracefully.
- JS errors must not break prompt submission or chat display.
- Chat should never scroll-lock unless debugging console is toggled.
