# CLI Command Map Seed

This seed defines Will‚Äôs command-line interface behavior. It outlines all supported commands, how they‚Äôre grouped, and which flags, environments, tags, and options they support. It also ensures all commands are documented, extensible, and logically organized.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Command Structure Format

Each command entry includes:

```yaml
- name: string
  description: string
  category: string  # e.g., "reflex", "system", "user", "dev"
  usage: string
  flags: [string]
  tags: [string]
  aliases: [string]
  depends_on: [string]
  schedule: string (cron format, optional)
  environments: [string]  # e.g., ["dev", "prod", "offline"]
  interactive: bool
  audit: bool
  help_text:
    en: string
    es: string (optional)
```

## üß≠ Sample Commands

## ‚úÖ Built-In Enhancements

- **Tags** allow filtered lists and batch operations (`will run @daily`).
- **Aliases** allow short command shorthands or legacy support.
- **Schedules** allow auto-running with the Automation Scheduler.
- **Dependencies** prevent out-of-order execution of linked commands.
- **Environments** restrict command use to proper runtime conditions.
- **Audit** flags commands that should be tracked for history or security logs.
- **Localized Help** prepares for multilingual CLI documentation.
- **Interactive Mode** allows CLI commands to trigger step-by-step workflows.
- **Dry-Run Support** lets you preview destructive commands without executing them.

---

## üîí Command Safeguards

- Any destructive or high-impact command must:
  - Be tagged with `@caution` or `@danger`
  - Support `--confirm` or `--force` flags
  - Trigger a confirmation prompt in interactive mode

---

## üß© Custom Command Extension

New commands should follow the same YAML format and be injected via `command_hooks` or by editing this seed and regenerating CLI mapping.

---

This seed ensures Will can operate safely, predictably, and flexibly in CLI environments ‚Äî now and as he grows.
