# automation_scheduler_seed.md

This seed file defines how Will schedules, manages, prioritizes, and monitors automated tasks, reflexes, and workflows. It enables intelligent execution order, resource-aware decision-making, and flexible scheduling across all projects.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Automation Principles

- **Tasks are defined in YAML** and contain metadata like triggers, frequency, dependencies, and resource requirements.
- **Autonomy is enabled** ‚Äî Will can schedule and execute tasks without user input (unless flagged otherwise).
- **System-aware** ‚Äî Will checks CPU/memory load before running heavy processes and avoids interrupting active user sessions.

---

## üß† Scheduling Types

```yaml
schedule_types:
  - manual          # Triggered by user request or CLI
  - interval        # Runs every X minutes/hours/days
  - cron            # Follows a standard cron expression
  - on_startup      # Executes when Will boots
  - on_event        # Triggered by system events or file changes
  - webhook         # Triggered by external HTTP request
```

---

## ‚è± Sample Task Format

```yaml
- name: "daily_memory_check"
  type: interval
  frequency: 24h
  function: "reflexes/check_memory_health.py::run"
  priority: high
  requires: ["memory_indexing"]
  max_runtime: 5m
  allow_retry: true
  retry_strategy:
    delay: 10m
    backoff: exponential
  audit_log: true
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Dependency Mapping

Tasks can declare dependencies using:

```yaml
depends_on:
  - run_backup
  - refresh_insights
```

Will will defer execution until upstream tasks complete successfully.

---

## üìä Priority & Load Management

Will classifies tasks by priority:

- `critical`: always executes when scheduled, alerts on failure
- `high`: important operational reflexes
- `medium`: default level for routine workflows
- `low`: background work (e.g. dashboard refresh)

During high system load, lower-priority tasks are:
- Throttled
- Deferred
- Reordered for optimal system balance

---

## üßΩ Smart Throttling Rules

If a task:
- Repeatedly fails
- Runs unusually long
- Consumes excess memory

Will will:
- Back off future attempts
- Log diagnostics to `self_diagnostic.log`
- Notify admin if flagged as critical

---

## üß∞ Scheduling Templates (Reusable)

Example:

```yaml
template: "daily_analysis"
schedule: "daily"
function: "reflexes/analyze_data.py::run"
args: ["source"]
```

Use to spawn multiple variants:

```yaml
- name: "daily_sales_analysis"
  template: "daily_analysis"
  args: ["sales"]

- name: "daily_traffic_analysis"
  template: "daily_analysis"
  args: ["traffic"]
```

---

## üôã User Confirmation Option

Certain tasks may require explicit user approval before execution:

```yaml
require_confirmation: true
```

Will will prompt you before proceeding.

---

## üßæ Logging & Audit Trail

All scheduled tasks include:

- Timestamp of start/finish
- Result summary or error
- Trigger source (user, reflex, external)
- System metrics during run

Used to generate weekly system health reports.

---

## üß† Time-of-Day Awareness

Will adapts to typical usage patterns:
- Runs cosmetic or low-priority jobs during idle hours
- Delays non-urgent work when the user is active

---

## üåê External Trigger Support (Future-Ready)

Stub hooks are included for:

```yaml
external_trigger:
  service: "Google Calendar"
  event: "Weekly Sync"
```

```yaml
webhook_trigger: "https://api.yourbiz.com/on-client-upload"
```

---

## üß™ CLI Integration

Tasks can be triggered or listed via:

```bash
will schedule list
will schedule run daily_backup
will schedule status reflex_refresh
```

---

## üß© Reflex & Automation Ecosystem Integration

Each scheduled task can:
- Trigger reflexes
- Call external APIs
- Launch custom scripts
- Pass status/results to memory logs for future context

---

**This scheduler ensures Will runs like a well-oiled machine ‚Äî proactive, aware, and never in your way.**
