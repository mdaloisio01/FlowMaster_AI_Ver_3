# diagnostics_dashboard_seed.md

## Purpose
To give Will a real-time, interactive overview of its system health, diagnostics, and performance. This dashboard acts as the ‚Äúnerve center‚Äù of self-awareness ‚Äî alerting the user and triggering internal reflexes when things go wrong (or drift silently over time).

---

## Core Features

### ‚úÖ System Health Summary
- Show Will's internal system status:
  - CPU load
  - Memory usage
  - Disk space
  - Network latency
  - Active reflex count
  - Queue length

### ‚úÖ Live Reflex Monitoring
- Show running, queued, and failed reflexes
- Highlight bottlenecks or reflexes taking longer than normal
- Auto-retry or log flagged ones for inspection

### ‚úÖ API Health Check
- Confirm OpenAI and any 3rd-party APIs are responsive
- Monitor error codes (e.g., 429, 401, 500)
- Track current API key status and remaining credits if available

### ‚úÖ Storage Monitor
- File counts, memory log size, and backup space remaining
- Quarantine file list with timestamps and failure reasons
- Automatically clear temp/cache folders if nearing space limits

---

## Advanced Diagnostics & Future-Proofing

### üìä Historical Baseline Tracking
- Compare current system values to rolling averages
- Alert when performance significantly deviates (even if technically "working")

### üß† Reflex Drift Detection
- Verify reflex file integrity using checksums
- Alert if a reflex is edited, deleted, or corrupted
- Optionally auto-restore from backup

### ü™µ Auto-Snapshot on Errors
- On critical failure, Will will:
  - Log full tracebacks
  - Save active config, reflex stack, and memory snapshot
  - Store in `/diagnostics/snapshots/{timestamp}/`

### üß™ Plugin & Toolchain Load Checks
- Confirm all expected modules and reflexes are loaded
- Highlight missing, broken, or deprecated utilities

### üí∞ API Usage Monitor
- Track total calls, failures, cost estimates
- Alert user if nearing limits or abuse risk
- Flag unusual spike in token usage

## CLI Tools
Will should support basic CLI commands to interact with this dashboard:

```bash
will status          # Show quick health summary
will logs today      # View today's error and warning logs
will reflex slow     # List slowest reflexes from past hour
will baseline diff   # Compare today vs last known good baseline
will snapshot create # Manually trigger snapshot + backup
```

---

## Dashboard Output Formats
- **CLI Summary Mode**: Short color-coded breakdown
- **Full Report Mode**: Markdown or HTML export
- **Auto-email / notify**: If connected to alert system, Will can send health check status daily or upon error

---

## Notifications
- User gets notified when:
  - Critical errors or unhandled exceptions occur
  - Reflexes fail more than X times in a row
  - Storage or memory thresholds are breached
  - External API limits are approaching

---

## Future Plans
- Integrate anomaly detection via basic ML (e.g., reflex duration regression)
- Add frontend UI widget inside the Will web interface for live health panel
- Reflex Suggestions: Based on error type, suggest installing or tweaking specific reflexes
