# IronRoot Summary

IronRoot AI is a sovereign AI system designed to act as the intelligent backbone of any business operation. It runs autonomously, learns recursively, and evolves through reflex-based modularity. It does not depend on external APIs to function, but can integrate with them if needed. Its mission: reduce cognitive overhead, automate processes, and amplify operational strength.

Core traits include:
- Modular reflexes (skills)
- Memory persistence via SQLite
- CLI + GUI interfaces
- Daemon mode and offline capability
- GPT-enhanced cognition
- Sovereign operator alignment

IronRoot AI operates with simplicity, trust, and quiet strength â€” always focused on doing the work, not showing off.
