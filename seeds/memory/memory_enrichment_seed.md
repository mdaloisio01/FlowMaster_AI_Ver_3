üìÑ memory_enrichment_seed.md
üß† Purpose:
To define how Will enhances, tags, links, and improves raw memory entries during ingestion and post-processing. This enables smarter recall, context-aware interaction, and faster system performance.

üîç Enrichment Rules
1. Auto Tagging
Will automatically scans memory entries for useful context tags:

Extracts project, topic, and keywords

Detects common structures (e.g., tasks, bugs, notes, plans)

Applies confidence-based tags (e.g. todo, question, decision, bug)

2. Summarization
Each memory is optionally paired with a compact summary using:

Sentence compression and NLP parsing

GPT summarization for longer entries

Purpose: Quick-glance recall and dashboard display.

3. Linking & Threading
Will threads related entries together based on:

Shared topic/project

Overlapping keywords

Temporal proximity

Manual user pins or overrides

This supports smart retrieval and cross-referencing during context expansion.

4. Smart Labels
Entries are analyzed and labeled using lightweight LLM classification into:

task, note, meeting, idea, bug, fix, decision, draft, command, etc.

Improves dashboard filtering and allows Will to prioritize and recall with relevance.

5. Tone and Intent Detection
Will uses natural language signals to detect:

Tone: neutral, casual, urgent, technical, frustrated, etc.

Intent: request, reminder, log, directive, feedback, etc.

These become searchable filters and memory cues.

‚öôÔ∏è Operational Enhancements
‚úÖ Enrichment Versioning
Each enriched entry includes:

yaml
Copy
Edit
enrichment_version: 1.0.0
This allows updates to the enrichment pipeline without reprocessing or losing consistency.

‚úÖ Sensitive Data Auto-Tagging
Will automatically tags entries as sensitive if:

API keys, passwords, tokens, or PII detected

Manual user flag

Optional: trigger quarantine or restricted access policies.

‚úÖ Language Detection
Entries are tagged with language code:

yaml
Copy
Edit
language: en
‚Üí Enables multi-language support and auto-translation in future phases.

‚úÖ Enrichment Logging
For every enriched memory, Will stores a log of actions taken:

yaml
Copy
Edit
enrichment_log:
  - summarized
  - tagged: [todo, urgent]
  - linked_to: memory_1083
Useful for audit trails and debugging.

üßΩ Optional: Memory Compression
Older or low-priority entries can be optionally:

Summarized

Original content archived

Marked as compressed

‚Üí Helps keep system fast while retaining context if needed later.

üí° Design Principles
Speed first: Enrichment is lightweight unless deep analysis is explicitly triggered.

Fail gracefully: If enrichment fails, memory still stores normally.

Human override always allowed: You can manually edit or tag any memory entry.

Future compatible: Designed to evolve with smarter AI, plugins, or dashboard filters.
