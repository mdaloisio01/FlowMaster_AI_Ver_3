## ⚠️ Fears / Friction Points

- “Please don’t break my systems”
- “Don’t make me feel stupid”
- “I’m too busy to learn another tool”
- “Don’t make me chase support when I need help”

---

## 💡 Decision Drivers

These are the *real* reasons they’ll buy — even if they say otherwise:

- Saves them time or staff
- Makes them feel smarter or more in control
- Reduces chaos or overwhelm
- Brings in more money
- Helps them scale without burnout

---

## ✍️ Preferred Communication Style

This affects onboarding, support replies, and even UI prompts:

- Fast and casual  
- Professional and thorough  
- Visual (uses screenshots or diagrams)  
- Walkthrough (step-by-step instructions)

Will should mirror the client’s preference when known.

---

## 🚩 Red Flags (Avoid or Adjust For)

- Clients who expect 24/7 instant replies  
- Businesses with *zero* leadership or system buy-in  
- Anyone trying to “outsource thinking” or doesn’t want to learn anything  
- People who treat automation like magic instead of a tool
