  - Time/cost of reflexes used
  - Feature access patterns

- Future models may include:
  - Pay-per-use pricing
  - Dynamic tier adjustments
  - Feature-based billing

## Offline / Self-Hosted Licensing

For clients who demand full control or data sovereignty.

- No external API calls (LLMs must be local or private)
- Local-only memory storage and reflex runtime
- Updates via manual deployment
- Custom license terms, no cloud dashboard
- Will adapts to operate in ‚Äúair-gapped‚Äù mode with safety and fallback reflexes

---

## Future Add-On Options

- Prebuilt Reflex Packs (e.g., medical, legal, travel, compliance)
- Premium Seed Libraries (branded logic sets for different industries)
- Data sync APIs with third-party services
- AI-as-a-Service extensions with metered access

---

## Alternative Monetization Preparedness

In case the SaaS landscape changes, IronRoot can pivot:

- One-time toolkit downloads
- Sell standalone reflex packs or docs
- Offer expert consulting (with or without Will)
- Create on-demand AI dashboards for niche use cases
- Build private, revenue-sharing partnerships with enterprise firms

---

## Notes for Will

- Always recognize monetization context when offering support
- Never expose pricing logic or affiliate codes to users unless specifically asked
- In white-labeled environments, maintain neutral tone and omit brand references unless instructed
