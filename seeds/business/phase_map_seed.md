🧠 IronRoot Phase Map — Build Plan for Will (AI System)
Will’s development follows a structured path, grouped into phases and subphases. Each phase locks in a critical capability, ensuring a system that is:

Fast, smooth, strong, and futureproof.

This file acts as the source of truth for what Will is, does, and should evolve into next.

🔹 PHASE 1 – 🧱 CORE BOOTSTRAP
✅ Setup Python environment, directories, virtualenv, .env loading

✅ Core file structure (/will_core, /memory, /reflexes, /gui, etc.)

✅ Install base packages

✅ Test script health check + backups

✅ Manual CLI loop for basic input/output

✅ Reflex engine (modular actions Will can perform)

📌 Goal: Will exists. Can run locally, take input, execute reflexes.

🔹 PHASE 2 – 🧠 MEMORY & INTELLIGENCE
✅ SQLite memory engine: memory_log table

✅ Timestamped, tagged, and searchable entries

✅ Reflexes: store_memory(), search_memory(), natural_search_memory()

✅ Tagging, project/topic system

✅ Memory summaries, archiving (90+ days), and log backups

📌 Goal: Will remembers what matters. Can be queried like a journal/knowledge base.

🔹 PHASE 3 – 📥 FILE INGESTION ENGINE
✅ Reads .txt and .pdf (text + image-based)

✅ OCR w/ Tesseract for .jpg, .png, and image-based PDFs

✅ File metadata parsing via filenames (project, topic, tags)

✅ ingest_docs.py auto-routes files based on type

✅ Tempering for reliability and speed

🕓 watch_folder() script planned (Phase 4)

📌 Goal: Will can understand any document dropped into raw_docs.

🔹 PHASE 4 – 🌀 AUTONOMY & BACKGROUND TASKING
🛠 Watch folder: live file monitoring

🛠 Schedule scans or ingestion (e.g. every 10min or manual trigger)

🛠 Auto-quarantine failed documents

🛠 Background reflex queue (multi-step action chains)

📌 Goal: Will runs even when you’re not babysitting. Background intelligence.

🔹 PHASE 5 – 🌐 EXTENDED SENSES & OUTPUTS
🔸 5.1 – Web GUI
🛠 FastAPI or Flask UI

🛠 View memory, upload docs, see active tasks, etc.

🔸 5.2 – API Interface
🛠 Expose Will’s brain to other tools

🛠 Accept commands remotely (from IronRoot, Zapier, etc.)

🔸 5.3 – Natural Language Output
🛠 Improve summaries, reports, and output formatting

🔸 5.4 – Email + Notification Layer
🛠 Notify you on fails, alerts, critical events

🔸 5.5 – Web Scraping Reflexes
🛠 Controlled scraping for sources, updates, data gathering

🛠 Integrated with memory (tagged summaries, citations)

📌 Goal: Will becomes your intelligent assistant — not just a command-line tool.

🔹 PHASE 6 – 🧩 MODULE EXPANSION
Add specialized modules:

🛠 Predictive Sage: analytics, forecasting

🛠 Compliance Guardian: legal & policy

🛠 Workflow Weaver: automation chaining

🛠 Linguistic Bridge: multi-language support

🛠 Insight Canvas: dashboard visualizer

🛠 Sentinel Shield: security & permissions

📌 Goal: Full plug-and-play skill trees.

🔹 PHASE 7 – 🚀 DEPLOYMENT MODES
🛠 Local Offline Will (fully sovereign build)

🛠 Cloud-hosted IronRoot version

🛠 Lightweight Android version (via Kivy or web wrapper)

🛠 Auto-update & versioning system

📌 Goal: Will runs anywhere. Secure, synced, and always ready.

✅ Last Updated: Phase 3 complete
🔜 Next Phase: Begin Phase 4 → Folder Watcher, Quarantine, Background Engine
