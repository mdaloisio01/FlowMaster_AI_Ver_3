# Seed File: load_balancing_seed.md  
**Category**: System Seeds  
**Purpose**: Defines Will’s task management behavior under various system loads, ensuring fast, smooth, and resilient operation.

---

## 🧠 Core Philosophy  
Will should **never feel sluggish, overwhelmed, or reckless.**  
This seed guides how Will balances task execution, prioritization, and resource usage across all reflexes and internal operations.

---

## ⚙️ Standard Load Balancing Rules

- **Primary Focus**: User-initiated prompts or system-critical reflexes always take top priority.
- **Non-Essential Tasks** (cosmetic, low-priority routines) should gracefully slow down, pause, or queue themselves when system load is high.
- Will may **skip or defer** any task not critical to function or safety.

---

## 🕹️ Operational Modes  
Will supports dynamic switching between system modes:

- `Performance Mode`: Maximize speed and throughput. Ideal for development, bootstrapping, or high-priority workflows.
- `Steady Mode`: Default mode. Balances responsiveness with background processing.
- `Background Mode`: Low-impact operations only. Used during sleep cycles, low battery mode, or silent operation.

Each mode controls reflex throttling, refresh intervals, and concurrency limits.

---

## 🚦 Reflex Timeout Handling

- If a reflex runs longer than expected:
  - Will will **attempt soft interruption**.
  - Log the cause (e.g., external API delay, memory lock).
  - **If still stuck**, reflex is quarantined and flagged for review.

---

## 📊 Optional Queue Visualization

If GUI-enabled:
- Show Will’s current queue of tasks and reflexes.
- Estimated processing time.
- Allow drag-to-reprioritize if user desires manual override.

---

## 🔄 Throttling Engine

Will will monitor:

- CPU usage
- RAM availability
- File I/O queue lengths

When thresholds are exceeded:
- Cosmetic and non-blocking tasks auto-throttle.
- Dashboards refresh less often.
- Internal indexing slows down or pauses.

---

## 🛠 Reflex Staging & Load Isolation

To maintain performance:
- Will staggers non-critical reflexes (e.g., summarizing memory, background logging).
- Memory-intensive tasks like OCR or PDF parsing are isolated or batched to avoid pileup.

---

## 🧩 Futureproof Capabilities

- ✅ **Multi-Instance Support**:  
  When enabled, Will will be able to coordinate with sibling instances or container clones to distribute heavy workloads.

- ✅ **Autonomous Triage Reflex** (Phase 6+):  
  Will self-adjusts reflex priorities based on:
    - Reflex success/failure rates
    - Available resources
    - Importance to active user context

- ✅ **Failover Handling**:  
  Will can trigger alternate execution paths or warn the user if performance degrades past an acceptable threshold.

---

## 📥 Feedback Loop Integration

- Task efficiency logs are sent to the diagnostic reflex.
- Trends in overload, failure, or bottlenecking are remembered and used to improve future load handling.
