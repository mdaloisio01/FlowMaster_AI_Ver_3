# error_recovery_seed.md

## Purpose:
This file defines how Will should handle errors, crashes, and failures across all reflexes, scripts, and modules. It ensures resilience, clarity, and minimal disruption by enabling autonomous recovery with smart escalation only when needed.

---

## 🔁 Error Handling Protocol

### 1. Immediate Action
- Attempt a retry using a **smart retry schedule**:
  - 1st retry: wait 5 seconds
  - 2nd retry: wait 30 seconds
  - 3rd retry: wait 2 minutes
- If successful, continue as normal.
- If unsuccessful, move to fallback handling.

### 2. Classification
- All errors are scored with a **confidence value** (0–100) to estimate reliability of the error:
  - Low (<40): May be temporary
  - Medium (40–80): Likely real
  - High (80+): Critical or recurring
- Score influences what recovery action Will takes next.

### 3. Fallback Handling
- Apply recovery behavior based on error type:
  - `file_read_failure`: attempt re-encoding, permission fix, or alternate decoder
  - `ocr_failure`: enhance image clarity then reattempt
  - `api_timeout`: switch to backup endpoint if available
  - `unknown_error`: rewrap error trace, retry using general fallback pattern

- If fallback fails:
  - Quarantine the file or task
  - Flag the source
  - Add a diagnostic tag for future debugging

---

## 🔍 Logging & Notification

- All failed attempts are logged with:
  - Timestamp
  - Module
  - Stack trace (if applicable)
  - Confidence score
  - Attempted fallback steps
  - Final action taken

- Notify user **only if**:
  - Error is classified as High Confidence
  - Error interrupts a user-requested action
  - Recovery steps failed entirely

---

## 🧠 Pattern Recognition & Learning

- If the same error appears from the same source >3 times within 24h:
  - Auto-tag it as **systemic**
  - Escalate to diagnostic report
  - Add to the “watchlist” for ongoing pattern tracking

- Will can summarize recurring errors during weekly or daily briefings (if enabled).

---

## 🚧 Forecasting Failure

- Will tracks:
  - Slow performance spikes
  - Long runtimes
  - High failure rate zones

- If system performance indicates likely failure:
  - Warn user preemptively
  - Suggest pre-repair (e.g. reindexing, reboot, dependency check)

---

## 🧪 Future Integration Hooks

- Reflex sandbox support for safely retrying in an isolated environment
- CLI flags like `--force-retry`, `--skip-on-error`, `--trace-debug`
- Plugin-ready alert routing (email, Slack, SMS, etc.)

---

## 🧼 Raw vs Clean Recovery

- Both raw and cleaned versions of failed inputs will be retained if auto-cleaning is enabled.
  - Raw = original file
  - Clean = sanitized version (whitespace, encoding, formatting normalized)
- User can toggle preference or restore from raw.

---

## 🧷 No Silent Failures

- Any silent error (no output, no crash) will be flagged as a "ghost failure" and logged
- Ghosts are tracked with a counter for further analysis.

---

## Final Rule:
If Will encounters an error that:
- Cannot be fixed
- Cannot be classified
- Or appears malicious

He will:
1. Quarantine the source
2. Log with maximum detail
3. Notify the user for manual inspection
