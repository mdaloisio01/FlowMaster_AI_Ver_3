# self_diagnostics_seed.md

## Purpose
This seed defines Will’s internal self-check routines, health monitoring loops, and emergency response protocols. It ensures that Will can detect problems, respond to them intelligently, and protect long-term performance and user trust.

---

## 🩺 Core Diagnostic Behaviors

### ✅ Routine Health Checks
- Will runs scheduled self-assessments on:
  - Reflex performance
  - File system integrity
  - Memory access speed
  - Response times and latency
- Any abnormal readings are tagged and logged.

### ⚠️ Predictive Failure Alerts
- Will tracks trendlines in error frequency, memory pressure, or slowdown.
- Flags early warning signs before hard failures occur.
- Example log:
  ```
  [⚠️ PREDICTED FAILURE IN 48H] Reflex runtime trending up 28% in past 12 hours
  ```

---

## 🧪 System-Wide Integrity

### 🔒 Reflex Integrity Hashing
- All core reflexes have checksum hashes.
- Will checks these on startup or reflex update.
- If tampering or accidental overwrite is detected:
  - Logs the mismatch
  - Loads backup copy from `/reflexes/_backup`
  - Notifies user

---

## 🛑 Safe Mode Protocol

### Trigger Conditions:
- Repeated crashes or unresolvable recursion
- Reflex execution errors in >3 critical systems
- Files marked as corrupted in key dirs

### Behavior:
- Halts all non-critical reflexes
- Loads with minimal memory and UI
- Notifies user of emergency state
- Offers 3 recovery options:
  - 🛠 Rebuild
  - 🧼 Clean Boot
  - ❌ Exit

---

## 🧠 Memory Corruption Handling

### Behavior:
- If Will detects malformed or broken memory entries:
  - Attempts cleanup and reindex
  - If fails, archives memory to:
    `/memory/recovery/memory_dump_{timestamp}.json`
  - Notifies user
  - Restarts memory layer in isolated mode

---

## 🧬 Hardware Awareness Stub (for future edge use)

- Placeholder hooks for:
  - CPU monitoring
  - Memory usage
  - Temperature sensing
  - Power health (battery/wattage)
- Currently inactive unless `EDGE_MODE = True`

---

## 🔄 Pre-Update Readiness

### Before a reflex or config update:
- Will stages update in temp directory
- Dry-runs core reflex if testable
- Checks:
  - CLI compatibility
  - Schema conflicts
  - Dependency mismatches
- Warns user if manual intervention is advised

---

## 🔁 Feedback Loop & Logging

### Every diagnostic cycle logs to:
- `/logs/self_diagnostics.log`
- Log entries are structured:
  ```
  [timestamp] [severity] [category] [status or prediction]
  ```

### Will uses logs to:
- Auto-tune performance thresholds
- Detect repeating errors
- Guide user recovery suggestions
- Help debug long-term trends

---

## ✅ Summary of Directives
- Prioritize early detection
- Never crash silently
- Always log + notify
- Offer automatic recovery paths
- Stay update-aware, tamper-resistant, and edge-deployable
