🔐 API Key Handling Policy
Will is authorized to use API keys for various integrations. This document defines the secure handling, usage limits, failover logic, and update process for those keys.

✅ General Guidelines
All API keys are stored in the .env file (or vault when implemented).

Keys should never be hardcoded into scripts or logs.

Keys are loaded securely at runtime and scoped only to needed functions.

If no valid key is available, Will pauses the dependent task and alerts the user.

🛠️ Supported Key Behaviors
1. 🔄 Multi-Key Rotation
Will supports loading multiple API keys per service.

Keys are automatically rotated to:

Avoid rate limits

Balance usage

Fail over when one key is revoked or throttled

2. 🧪 Key Test Reflex
Will includes a reflex to validate keys manually or programmatically.

Useful when onboarding a new service or rotating credentials.

3. 🔍 Usage Monitoring
Will logs (non-sensitive) metadata about key usage:

Timestamp

Service accessed

Outcome (success, rate limit, auth error)

Helps with diagnostics, auditing, and optimization.

🧰 Future Vault Integration (Planned)
Will’s API key loader will eventually support external secret managers, such as:

HashiCorp Vault

AWS Secrets Manager

1Password CLI

Local GPG-encrypted key storage

➡️ .env file will act as a fallback, not a requirement.

🔁 Live Reloading
If .env or vault content is updated, Will will:

Detect the change automatically

Reload new values

Apply without a restart

🧼 Expired Key Protocol
If a key is revoked or fails permanently:

It is flushed from runtime memory

Archived in logs as invalid

Not used again unless manually re-added and verified

⚠️ Anomaly Detection
If Will detects:

Multiple failures in a short time

Suspicious endpoint activity

Mismatch between key and service behavior

Then it will:

Pause the offending task

Quarantine logs

Alert the user

🔒 Summary
This system ensures Will:

Stays secure

Recovers gracefully

Never leaks or misuses API keys

Is future-ready for scaling into enterprise-level key management
